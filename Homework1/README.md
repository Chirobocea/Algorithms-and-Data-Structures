# Requirement

Implement sparse polynomials (represented by the coefficient, exponent pair) using a list.

It is a rare list ordered by exponent (we assume that the exponents are read in order, we do not sort).

Example: 7x^123 + 8x^22 + 15 could be (0.15)->(22.8)->(123.7)

Calculate the sum of two polynomials by interclassing the lists containing the terms.
